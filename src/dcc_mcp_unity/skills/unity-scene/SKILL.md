# Unity Scene

Inspect the hierarchy immediately before using instance IDs. Treat every Unity instance ID as an
opaque, session-scoped value and return it unchanged; Unity 6000.5+ emits decimal strings while
older Editors retain integer output for compatibility. Both forms are accepted as input. Object
creation and transform edits register with Unity Undo.

Do not automatically retry a timed-out mutation. Inspect the project and scene first because the
Editor may have completed the original request near the timeout boundary.

## Component authoring

Call `list_components` with a fresh hierarchy ID. Its `object_id` and `component_id`
handles expire on domain reload or object destruction. Add by fully qualified type
name; inspect the component before setting exact serialized property paths. Supply
`expected_fingerprint` to reject concurrent edits. Values support booleans, integers,
floats, strings, enum indices, vectors, colors, rectangles, bounds, and compatible
object references (`object_id` or an exact `Assets/` path). Existing nested fields
and array elements use Unity property paths; array resizing, curves, managed
references, event wiring, and direct prefab asset edits are unsupported in this
iteration. Unsupported fields are marked non-editable.

Batches validate in a SerializedObject before applying and use the command Undo
transaction for failures. Project component lifecycle callbacks can have their own
external side effects; Undo cannot roll those back. Results include normalized
readback and scene/prefab override state. No operation saves content. Review dirty
scenes before the existing `save_scene`, which saves all open scenes.
