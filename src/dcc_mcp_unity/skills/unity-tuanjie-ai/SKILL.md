# Tuanjie AI

Call `inspect_tuanjie_ai` first and execute only a tool name returned by that fresh result. Read its
`tool_descriptions` entry for provider-owned parameter, default, and recovery guidance; a null entry
means that a manually registered tool did not publish a native description. The adapter delegates
to the installed Tuanjie package; it does not copy its HTTP client, credentials, credit rules,
downloads, or recovery logic. Tuanjie/Codely sign-in and sufficient credits remain host
prerequisites. The official `cn.tuanjie.ai.generators` package is optional: other plugins can extend
this Skill by registering valid tools with the bridge's native `CustomTool` contract.

Generation can spend credits and import or replace project assets. Pass the current agent session
identifier when the native tool supports `session_id`, then poll with the matching native status tool.
Do not retry a timed-out submission: inspect native task/session state first. Verify generated assets
and their usage terms before shipping them.
