# Unity Diagnostics

Read the captured Unity Console after an operation or when the Editor reports a failure. Results
are bounded and may be truncated; increase `limit` up to 200 or narrow by severity when needed.

Persistent operations keep their Core async job open until Unity reports `succeeded` or `failed`;
wait on that job instead of replacing an ambiguous request with a new UUID. `inspect_job` remains
available for reconnect and audit recovery. `capture_game_view` is accepted only in active,
unpaused Play Mode, focuses Game View, waits a rendered frame, and succeeds only after Unity
decodes a bounded nonzero PNG in its fixed output directory.
